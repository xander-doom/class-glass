### Safari ‚ùå

Safari is not supported because development requires a Mac and I don't have one. You could probably get it working if you follow [the conversion steps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/converting-a-web-extension-for-safari).

### Other browsers

If you use another browser, you may be able to install Class Glass by enabling developer mode and installing the extension from source. Download this repo and google "developer add-on installation" for whatever browser you use.
